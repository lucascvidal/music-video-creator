# Soundful Bot

This project has evolved from a simple script for automating track creation in Soundful to a comprehensive bot that handles the entire process â€” from track creation and concatenation to video generation, including title, description, and tags. Additionally, it uploads the final video to YouTube.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Ruby and Python installed, specifically Ruby 3.2.2 and Python 3.9.2 in the current project development. Install the required packages:
```shell
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y ffmpeg imagemagick libmagickwand-dev libmagickcore-dev
```

Install Ruby gems:
```shell
bundle install
```

Install Python libraries:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create necessary directories:
```shell
mkdir tmp/
cd tmp/
mkdir audio/
mkdir image/
mkdir fonts/
```

Download Oswald Bold and Lato Heavy fonts from Google Fonts and place them in the fonts/ directory.

Create a .env file with the required variables (refer to the .env.example file). You need Soundful subscription credentials and OpenAI API Key.

Set up Google API credentials by creating a project on Google Cloud Platform, configuring OAuth for desktop apps, and downloading the credentials.json file to the project's root directory.

## Usage

- Prepare the Environment:
Ensure your .env file is configured with the necessary variables for Soundful, YouTube, and OpenAI.
- Run the Main Script:
Execute the main script to guide you through the entire process:
```shell
./soundful_bot.sh
```
- Follow Prompts:
The script will guide you step-by-step, providing prompts for user-specific details like user ID, video theme, thumbnail text, and OpenAI API key.
- Pause Between Tasks:
Keep in mind that there will be a pause of approximately 5 minutes between the creation and download of audio tracks, allowing sufficient time for the Soundful platform.
- Completion:
Upon completion, your video will be uploaded to YouTube, and the entire process will be seamlessly managed by the script.
